# PyBer Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
I created visualizations of ride-sharing data using a combination of Jupyter Notebook, matplotlib, and pandas dependencies with the intent to compare the number and fares of rides in urban, suburban and rural city types. These visualizations would highlight key correlations and disparaties that could improve access to and the affordability of ride-sharing services.
## Results
To start, I organized my datasets by merging them via the city column, and then used that merged dataset to pull relevant data for a DataFrame summary. A quick glance was enough to spot direct correlations between the amount of total drivers, fares, and rides and indirect correlation with the Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per driver.

From there, I created a multiple line plot that shows the total weekly of the fares for each type of city within the timeframe of 2019-01-01 and 2019-04-30.

## Summary
While the urban cities seem more profitable on the surface, the rural cities rides are in fact. more profitable. So, I would focus on improving access to rides within rural cities to increase revenue at lower cost.
